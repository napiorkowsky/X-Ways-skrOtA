Fix polish translation in files list raport

X-Ways (19.4-20.3) has a translation error when generating a list of files in polish language. Instead of word "Skrót" in table headers uses "Skrótą" or "Skrót ˛"
With this script in bash shell you can replace headers with MD5 and SHA1 text. Just need to pull the script to directory with HTMLs and run.
